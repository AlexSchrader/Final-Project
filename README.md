This is a web application that allows users to build a personalized meal plan for a week. The user can enter their name, email, and goal for the week in the provided form. The meal plan includes options for breakfast, snack, lunch, snack 2,
and dinner for each day of the week. Users can select a meal from a dropdown list, or they can enter a custom meal. The application also includes a "Generate Random Meals" button that randomly selects a meal for each day of the week.
The application also includes save and load buttons that allow users to save their meal plan data to local storage and load it back into the form. The save and load functionality is implemented using JavaScript and the localStorage API.
The application includes CSS styles for the form and meal plan table, as well as animations for various elements on the page. The CSS styles are written using CSS animations and transitions.
The application also includes JavaScript code that validates the email input, generates a random meal, fills the meal plan with random meals, generates the meal plan as an HTML table, and clears the meal plan.
The JavaScript code is written using modern JavaScript syntax and includes event listeners for the form buttons and the random plan button.
